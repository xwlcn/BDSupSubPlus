BDSup2SubPlus
=========
The original project address: https://github.com/mjuhasz/BDSup2Sub

Remove sup captioned timeline merge to make animation smoother(May produce a large number of images with the same text, if you don't need animations, consider adding a timeline merge feature later), and merge multiple ImageObjects in a SubPictureBD.

TODO
======
1. Since animations produce a large number of images with the same text, batch erasing can be added.
2. Edit picture text.
3. Insert a new graphic caption at some point in time(It can be complicated).

If you are interested, you can join in the maintenance.
